#Lua Coding Intelligent Agent
This is a pretrained agent for writing code in Lua. The vision is to improve the speed and accuracy for developers creating and testing Lua code. For people building games or AI with [Torch](http://torch.ch/) utilizing [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) will be able to more abstractly write their code with the help of an intelligent agent. There is still lots of work to be done.

#Installation and useage
This was taken directly from torch-rnn and trained. For instructions on installation and useage please see [their documentation](https://github.com/jcjohnson/torch-rnn).

#TODO
- More training of this agent can/should be done and submitted directly to this repository for others to improve upon.
- Create the ability to integrate with IDEs. The ability to output code is currently rudementary (e.g. just outputs arbitrary code into console).
- Build in some contextual indication for knowing when a certain peice of code should be used.
